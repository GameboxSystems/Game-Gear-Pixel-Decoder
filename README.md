# Game-Gear-Pixel-Decoder
VHDL implementation of a pixel decoder for the Sega Game Gear

* Inital version alpha v0.1 - untested rough implementation of pixel decoder with no top module (yet). Will be updated with top module and test bench once tested.

* 5/29/2022 alpha v0.2 - tested with hardware and pixel decoding works but with artifacts. further testing needed. Will be updated accordingly.

* 5/30/2022 v0.3 - Tested working implementation of the Game Gear pixel decoder. Will update with top module and constraints at a later point.
